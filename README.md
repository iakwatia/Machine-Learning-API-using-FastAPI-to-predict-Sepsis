Building an ML model to predict Sepsis and building an API using FastAPI to embed the built ML model

### Data 

The data consists of the following columns:

PRG: Plasma glucose

PL: Blood Work Result-1 (mu U/ml)

PR: Blood Pressure (mm Hg)

SK: Blood Work Result-2 (mm)

TS: Blood Work Result-3 (mu U/ml)

M11: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2

BD2: Blood Work Result-4 (mu U/ml)

Age: patients age (years)

Insurance: If a patient holds a valid insurance card

Sepsis: Positive: if a patient in ICU will develop a sepsis , and Negative: otherwi
